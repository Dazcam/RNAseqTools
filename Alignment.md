- [Tophat](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml): First widely used spliced-aware read mapper. Current version is Tophat2

- [HISAT](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml): Successor to Tophat2. Similar functionality, but n=much more computationally efficient

- [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR): Much faster than Tophat, but requires a large amount of memort (30 Gb for human genome)
